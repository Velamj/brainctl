# brainctl

A cognitive memory system for AI agents. Single SQLite file. No server required.

```python
from agentmemory import Brain

brain = Brain()
brain.remember("User prefers dark mode")
brain.search("dark mode")
brain.entity("Alice", "person", observations=["Engineer", "Likes Python"])
brain.relate("Alice", "works_at", "Acme")
brain.log("Deployed v2.0")
```

## MCP Server (Claude Desktop / VS Code)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brainctl": {
      "command": "brainctl-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

16 tools: `memory_add`, `memory_search`, `event_add`, `event_search`, `entity_create`, `entity_get`, `entity_search`, `entity_observe`, `entity_relate`, `decision_add`, `search`, `stats`, `affect_classify`, `affect_log`, `affect_check`, `affect_monitor`

## Install

```bash
pip install brainctl              # core
pip install brainctl[mcp]         # with MCP server
pip install brainctl[vec]         # with vector search (sqlite-vec)
pip install brainctl[all]         # everything
```

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install brainctl
brainctl init              # create brain.db
brainctl memory add 'my first memory' -c lesson
brainctl search 'memory'
brainctl affect classify 'deployment failed, team is panicking'
brainctl stats
```

## CLI

```bash
# Memories
brainctl memory add "Python 3.12 is the minimum version" -c convention
brainctl memory search "python version"

# Entities (typed knowledge graph)
brainctl entity create "Alice" -t person -o "Engineer; Likes Python; Based in NYC"
brainctl entity get Alice
brainctl entity relate Alice works_at Acme
brainctl entity search "engineer"

# Events
brainctl event add "Deployed v2.0 to production" -t result -p myproject
brainctl event search -q "deploy"

# Cross-table search (memories + events + entities)
brainctl search "deployment"

# Prospective memory (triggers that fire on future queries)
brainctl trigger create "Alice mentions vacation" -k vacation,alice -a "Remind about project deadline"
brainctl trigger check "alice is going on vacation"

# Stats
brainctl stats
```

## Architecture

```
brain.db (single SQLite file, 80+ tables)
├── memories        FTS5 full-text + optional vec search
├── events          timestamped logs with importance scoring
├── entities        typed nodes (person, project, tool, concept...)
├── knowledge_edges directed relations between any table rows
├── decisions       recorded with rationale
├── memory_triggers prospective memory (fire on future conditions)
├── affect_log      per-agent functional affect state tracking
└── 60+ more tables (consolidation, beliefs, policies, epochs...)

Consolidation Engine (hippocampus.py)
├── Confidence decay    — unused memories fade
├── Temporal promotion  — frequently-accessed memories strengthen
├── Dream synthesis     — discover non-obvious connections
├── Hebbian learning    — co-retrieved memories form edges
├── Contradiction detection
└── Compression         — merge redundant memories

Write Gate (W(m))
├── Surprise scoring    — reject redundant memories at the door
├── Worthiness check    — surprise × importance × (1 - redundancy)
└── Force flag          — bypass for explicit writes
```

## Consolidation Engine

The hippocampus is brainctl's memory consolidation system — it makes memories behave like biological memory:

```bash
brainctl-consolidate decay          # confidence decay on unused memories
brainctl-consolidate compress       # merge redundant memories
brainctl-consolidate dream          # discover non-obvious connections
brainctl-consolidate promote        # promote important events to memories
brainctl-consolidate sweep          # full maintenance cycle
```

Schedule it with cron for autonomous memory maintenance:
```bash
# Run consolidation every 4 hours
0 */4 * * * BRAIN_DB=~/brain.db brainctl-consolidate sweep
```

## Vector Search (Optional)

brainctl works without embeddings. For vector search, install Ollama and sqlite-vec:

```bash
pip install brainctl[vec]
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
brainctl-embed                    # backfill embeddings
brainctl vsearch "semantic query" # vector similarity search
```

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t brainctl .
docker run -v ./data:/data brainctl              # MCP server
docker run -v ./data:/data brainctl brainctl stats  # CLI
```

## Multi-Agent

Every operation accepts `--agent` / `agent_id` for attribution:

```bash
brainctl -a agent-alpha memory add "learned something" -c lesson
brainctl -a agent-beta entity observe "Alice" "Now leads the team"
```

Agents share one brain.db. Each write is attributed. Search sees everything.

## Affect Tracking

Functional affect states grounded in the Anthropic 2026 paper on emotion-analogues
in AI systems. This is not sentiment analysis — it tracks internal operational
states (frustration, urgency, satisfaction, confusion, confidence, curiosity) that
influence memory formation and retrieval.

### CLI

```bash
brainctl affect classify 'the deploy failed and rollback is stuck'
# → {"state": "frustration", "valence": -0.7, "arousal": 0.8, ...}

brainctl affect log 'finally resolved the outage after 4 hours'
# logs the affect state with timestamp to brain.db

brainctl affect check
# show current affect state and recent trajectory

brainctl affect monitor --watch
# live-stream affect state changes
```

### Python API

```python
from agentmemory import Brain

brain = Brain()
state = brain.affect("deployment failed, team is panicking")
# → AffectState(state='frustration', valence=-0.7, arousal=0.8)

brain.affect_log("resolved the outage")
# logs affect + text to the affect_log table
```

### Safety Patterns

Six built-in safety patterns prevent affect states from causing harmful behavior:

1. **Cooldown gating** — high-arousal states trigger a write cooldown
2. **Valence-aware retrieval** — negative states bias toward safety-relevant memories
3. **Escalation detection** — sustained negative trajectories flag for review
4. **Affect decay** — states decay toward neutral over time
5. **Override mechanism** — explicit flags bypass affect-based gating
6. **Audit trail** — all affect state changes are logged immutably

### Integration

Affect states feed into the write gate and consolidation engine:
- **Write gate**: high-arousal states increase the surprise threshold (harder to write impulsively)
- **Consolidation**: affect-tagged memories get priority during dream synthesis
- **Retrieval**: current affect biases search ranking toward state-relevant memories

## Token Cost Optimization

brainctl is designed to **reduce** your model's token usage, not increase it. Without persistent memory, agents waste tokens re-reading files, re-asking questions, and re-discovering their environment every session. brainctl eliminates that — but only if configured well.

### Output Formats

Every search command supports `--output` to control token consumption:

```bash
brainctl search "deploy" --output json      # default: pretty JSON (~2200 tokens)
brainctl search "deploy" --output compact   # minified JSON (~1700 tokens, ~24% savings)
brainctl search "deploy" --output oneline   # ID|type|text (~60 tokens, ~97% savings)
```

For agents that just need facts (not full metadata), `--output oneline` is the single biggest cost reduction you can make.

### Budget Caps

Hard-cap search output at a token limit:

```bash
brainctl search "deploy" --budget 500       # trim lowest-ranked results until output fits
brainctl search "deploy" --limit 3          # fewer results = fewer tokens
brainctl search "deploy" --min-salience 0.1 # suppress low-relevance noise
```

### Cost Dashboard

See exactly where tokens are going:

```bash
brainctl cost
```

Shows: format savings comparison, queries/tokens today and last 7 days, top token-consuming agents, and actionable recommendations.

### Design Principles for Low-Cost Usage

1. **Query the brain, don't inject it.** Don't dump memory into every system prompt. Search when relevant.
2. **Use oneline for routine lookups.** Full JSON is for debugging. Agents need facts, not metadata.
3. **Set --budget on automated queries.** Cron jobs and heartbeats should cap their own output.
4. **Limit scope.** `--tables memories` skips events/context. `--category convention` narrows further.
5. **Let salience filtering work.** `--min-salience 0.1` drops noise that wastes tokens downstream.
