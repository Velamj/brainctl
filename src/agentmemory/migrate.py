"""brainctl migration runner.

Reads migration SQL files from db/migrations/, applies unapplied ones in order,
tracks applied migrations in schema_versions table.

============================================================================
DUPLICATE-VERSION HISTORY (read this before adding a new migration)
============================================================================

Up to v2.1.x, eight migration files in db/migrations/ shared four version
numbers (012, 013, 017, 023). The runner sorts files alphabetically and
records the integer version once it finishes the FIRST file at that
version; the SECOND file at the same version was then silently skipped
forever on fresh DBs because its version was already in
``schema_versions``.

Subsystems lost on fresh installs:
  * 012_theory_of_mind.sql        (agent_beliefs, belief_conflicts,
                                    agent_perspective_models, agent_bdi_state)
  * 013_global_workspace.sql      (workspace_config/broadcasts/acks/phi)
  * 017_memory_rbac.sql           (memories.visibility/read_acl)
  * 023_uncertainty_log_search_columns.sql
                                  (agent_uncertainty_log search columns)

In v2.2.0 these four files were renumbered to slots 043-046 (the next
free integers above the previous high-water 042) and made idempotent
(``CREATE TABLE/INDEX/TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS``; ADD COLUMN duplicate-column
errors swallowed by ``_apply_sql`` below). Existing brain.db installs
that already have the affected tables — including the user's own DB,
which had ad-hoc patches — pick up the renumbered migrations as no-ops
on the next ``brainctl migrate`` run.

DESIGN RATIONALE — why option (a) renumber, not (b) suffix-ordinal:
  1. SQLite triggers reference tables lazily; CREATE TRIGGER does not
     validate referenced tables, so moving a defining migration to a
     LATER slot does not break create-time ordering for
     trigger-bearing downstream migrations.
  2. The only cross-migration table reference among the lost-pair
     payloads is ``017_global_workspace_memory_columns`` inserting into
     ``workspace_broadcasts`` (defined in 013_global_workspace) inside
     a trigger body. That trigger only fires on UPDATE OF gw_broadcast,
     never at migrate time.
  3. Option (b) would have required a schema_versions table migration
     of its own (adding a suffix column) — solving a problem the
     simpler renumber doesn't have.

WHEN ADDING A NEW MIGRATION:
  * Pick the next unused integer above the current max (use
    ``brainctl migrate --status-verbose`` or ``ls db/migrations/``).
  * Use ``CREATE TABLE/INDEX/TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS``.
  * For ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN, just write it plain — ``_apply_sql``
    catches the duplicate-column failure on re-apply. SQLite has no
    native ``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` syntax.
  * If you write the inner ``INSERT INTO schema_version (version, ...)``
    row, make sure the integer matches the file's ordinal.
  * Run ``python3 -c "from agentmemory import migrate;
    migrate._check_no_duplicate_versions()"`` — it will raise loudly
    if you accidentally introduce another duplicate.

    """Like status(), plus per-migration heuristic: does the schema already
    look like this migration has run?

    The heuristic is cheap and best-effort: for each migration file, parse
    ADD COLUMN statements and CREATE TABLE statements, then check
    sqlite_master / PRAGMA table_xinfo to see if those columns/tables
    exist. If everything the migration would create already exists, mark it
    "likely-applied". If nothing exists, mark it "pending". Mixed state →
    "partial".

    Uses PRAGMA table_xinfo (not table_info) so generated virtual columns
    added via `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...)
    VIRTUAL` are detected — table_info hides them.

    The ADD COLUMN regex tolerates `IF NOT EXISTS` between COLUMN and the
    column name, so migrations like
    `ALTER TABLE access_log ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tokens_consumed`
    don't get mis-classified with `IF` as the column name.

    Used by `brainctl doctor` and `brainctl migrate --status-verbose` to
    help users pick a safe value for `--mark-applied-up-to N`.
