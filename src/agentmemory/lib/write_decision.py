"""
Built-in W(m) write worthiness gate for brainctl.

Evaluates candidate memories against existing embeddings to determine
if the write is novel enough to proceed. Returns (score, reason, components).

score: float 0.0-1.0 (higher = more worthy)
reason: str (empty string = approved, non-empty = rejection reason)
components: dict of scoring breakdown

D-MEM RPE routing (issue #31):
  score < 0.3  → SKIP       (discard, no insert)
  0.3 ≤ score < 0.7 → CONSTRUCT_ONLY  (write, no embedding/FTS)
  score ≥ 0.7  → FULL_EVOLUTION  (write + embed + FTS)

Long-term utility added as a scoring component:
  - category_weight: identity/decision > lesson > convention > general
  - scope_weight: agent-scoped > project-scoped > global
  - recall_rate: historical avg recall_rate from memory_stats (if available)
