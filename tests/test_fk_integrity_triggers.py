"""Regression tests for migration 048: FK integrity DELETE triggers + FTS5 retire-aware re-index.

Background
----------
The 2026-04-16 correctness audit (memory 1675) flagged that only 2 of 47
migrations declare ON DELETE clauses on FK columns. SQLite does not support
``ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT``, so we cannot retroactively add ``ON DELETE
CASCADE``/``SET NULL`` to existing tables without rebuilding them. Migration
048 emulates the intended cascade behavior with idempotent DELETE/UPDATE
triggers that fire when ``PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF`` (raw SQL maintenance,
or ``merge.py:586`` which deliberately disables FK enforcement).

What this file pins
-------------------
1. Hard-deleting an ``agents`` row nullifies dangling
   ``memories.validation_agent_id`` references (preserves history row).
2. Hard-deleting a ``memories`` row cascade-deletes ``knowledge_edges`` rows
   that name it as source or target. The task spec said "null out", but the
   columns are ``NOT NULL`` and cannot be set to NULL via trigger, so we
   delete the edges instead — they're meaningless without their referent.
3. Same cascade for ``entities`` and ``events``.
4. Retiring a memory (``UPDATE memories SET retired_at = ...``) immediately
   removes its row from ``memories_fts`` — no waiting for
   ``cmd_vec_purge_retired``. This is achieved by migration 048 converging
   the legacy single ``memories_fts_update`` trigger to the packaged
   split-pair pattern (``_update_delete`` + ``_update_insert``) with a
   ``new.retired_at IS NULL`` guard on the insert leg. We learned the hard
   way that a separate ``AFTER UPDATE OF retired_at`` purge trigger does
   NOT work: plain ``DELETE FROM memories_fts`` corrupts content-linked
   FTS5 segments, and the proper ``'delete'`` command idiom is no-op'd by
   FTS5 statement-level batching against the just-issued INSERT from
   ``memories_fts_update``. Preventing the re-INSERT in the first place is
   the only correct fix.

These tests use a raw ``sqlite3`` connection on a temp DB seeded from
``db/init_schema.sql`` (the same path ``brainctl init`` takes for fresh
installs) so they exercise the trigger DDL exactly as a brand-new user
would see it. They explicitly set ``PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF`` for the
cascade tests because with FK enforcement ON, the parent DELETE is rejected
before the AFTER DELETE trigger ever runs.
