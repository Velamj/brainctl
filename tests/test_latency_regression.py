"""Latency regression gate.

Compares a fresh harness run against the committed
``tests/bench/baselines/latency.json`` and fails if any p95 metric
regressed by more than ``REGRESSION_THRESHOLD`` (50% by default).

Why 50%
-------
Wall-clock latency on a laptop has wider variance than retrieval-quality
metrics. Empirically (perf/latency-baseline measurement run, 2026-04-18):
the SAME code/harness/scale measured back-to-back showed 30-50% drift
between sweeps as the machine warmed up under sustained load. The first
sweep showed brain_search_hybrid p95 ~30ms; a fresh sweep started 5
minutes later showed ~92ms; a fresh sweep run AFTER that one showed
~137ms. None of these were regressions — they were the same code in
different thermal/page-cache states.

Tighter thresholds (10-25%) flap on this kind of cross-sweep drift.
Looser thresholds (>60%) miss the regressions we actually want to
catch (someone adds an unbatched commit inside a hot loop, doubles a
PRAGMA call, etc).

50% is the lowest threshold that stayed flake-free across three
back-to-back full sweeps on the reference darwin/M-class hardware. If
your CI laptop has wider variance, raise this — but please also
investigate WHY the variance is wider (thermal, background tasks).

Compare to: ``tests/bench/run.py`` uses 2% for retrieval QUALITY metrics
(P@k, MRR, nDCG), which are deterministic given a fixed seed and so
have basically no machine-state dependence.

Sub-millisecond ops (baseline p95 < 1.0ms) bypass the ratio test and
use a flat +1.0ms absolute budget. Below 1ms we're measuring page-cache
hits and sqlite3.connect overhead, both of which jitter ±0.5ms on macOS
without indicating any real regression.

How to run
----------
Off by default — set ``BRAINCTL_RUN_BENCH=1`` (matches LOCOMO + LongMemEval):

    BRAINCTL_RUN_BENCH=1 pytest tests/test_latency_regression.py -v

Update the baseline after a deliberate change:

    python -m tests.bench.latency --update-baseline
    git add tests/bench/baselines/latency.json
    # commit with the intended-change explanation in the message

Why not run on every PR
-----------------------
~3-5 min wall on N=10k. Same gating model as the LOCOMO + LongMemEval
benches: opt-in for perf-relevant PRs and pre-release runs.

# cli_search_cold@1000 149ms vs 262ms — none of those deltas are real
# regressions, they're platform-dependent Python cold-start. Library-level
# ops (brain_search_*, brain_remember_*, vec_*) stay gated because they
# don't carry subprocess startup in their timing.
#
# To catch real CLI regressions, run the bench on a machine whose platform
